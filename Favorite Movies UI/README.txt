Read Me:

As this is my first app as well as first time working with Objective-C, I have learned what I would create this project differently in the future. I chose to learn Objective-C before moving to swift in order to learn the fundamentals (even if they are more difficult to understand) so that learning swift would be simpler with an in-depth understanding.
 
This app does not have a hierarchy of classes that would be useful if implemented correctly; such as including classes:
 
MovieRecord //class which holds parsed data in its properties
ImageDownloader //class which delegates methods which download images for ease of use and lazy loading
MovieItem //class which holds and links objects such as images and text to be used as items in CollectionView
CollectionView //class to create a view containing instances of MovieItems to display in a scrollable view
ViewController //class which controls and links other views.
 
Learning how to switch between threads, utilize completion handlers, and work with as well as around sandboxing is crucial in creation of this project and I had no prior experience in this field, although the fundamentals of how this works is demonstrated in this project. Thank you for taking the time to see my Movie Favorites UI App.
